Contractor shall follow an Agile development methodology, with iterative cycles and close collaboration  with GTA. The plan shall be broken down into Sprints, each delivering functional increments of GovHub  and Orchard. The high-level outline of the implementation is as follows: 
a. Sprint Planning: At the start of each Sprint, a planning session shall be held to determine the tasks  and features to be developed and prioritized based on GTA input and business value.  
b. Sprint Cycles: Development shall occur in two (2) week Sprints, each Sprint shall include the  following phases:  
i. Development: Design and coding of the prioritized features or enhancements.  
ii. Peer Review: For each task in a Sprint, peer review exercises must be performed on the  code to the standards established and agreed upon by the Contractor and GTA at the start  of the engagement. Once established, the standards shall be published and accessible to all Parties. Each feature to be added to the master code base must be approved by GTA to be  considered an approved Deliverable. 
iii. Testing: Each feature shall be tested within the Sprint, adhering to the testing procedures  detailed in Section 5 above.  
c. Deliverables for Each Sprint: Each Sprint shall produce a functional increment that can be tested  and reviewed by GTA. Deliverables shall include:  
i. Working feature enhancements 
ii. Routine and critical maintenance tasks 
iii. Unit, functional and automated test script creation 
iv. Documentation of changes and updates  
7. Backlog Refinement: During each Sprint, the backlog shall be revisited with the Contractor and  reprioritized based on progress, new insights, or changes in requirements.  
a. Continuous Feedback Loop: GTA and Contractor’s involvement is crucial during Sprint reviews,  allowing for adjustments to priorities and ensuring that the final product aligns with evolving  business needs. 
This Agile approach allows for flexibility, enabling changes in scope or priorities to be incorporated during  the development process without impacting overall timelines. Each Sprint shall be considered complete  upon GTA approval of the delivered features. 
8. Acceptance Criteria  
Acceptance of Deliverables shall occur before a feature or task is accepted into each Sprint, with a  focus on iterative feedback and continuous improvement. The criteria for accepting each Sprint’s  work are as follows: 
a. Definition of Done (“DoD”): For each feature or task, completion is based on meeting the agreed upon Definition of Done. This includes:
