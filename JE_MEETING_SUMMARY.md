# GovHub Resource Analysis for JE Meeting
*Data-driven insights for special initiatives discussion*

## ðŸŽ¯ **Bottom Line Answer for JE**

**You do NOT need to reduce maintenance hours or bring in Client Services resources for your initiatives. The team is massively under-utilizing SOW capacity.**

## ðŸ“Š **Key Findings**

### SOW Utilization Reality
- **Current Utilization**: 9.3% of contracted capacity
- **Hours Used**: 93 hours out of 1,000 expected (since April)
- **Monthly Under-utilization**: 181 hours/month
- **Remaining Capacity**: 907 hours available

### Team is Already Doing Professional Services
- **75%** Support & Maintenance work
- **25%** Professional Services work (initiatives, consulting)
- Team proven capable of handling both types of work

### Individual Team Contributions
- **Elvis Moreta**: 38.5h total (7.7h/month) - Mix of maintenance & professional
- **Alexander Pinchao**: 19.3h total (3.9h/month) - **Heavy professional services** (66%)
- **Cathy Theys**: 15.3h total (3.0h/month) - PM coordination
- **Marcos Cano**: 11.5h total (2.3h/month) - Pure maintenance
- **Alexis Saransig**: 8.5h total (1.7h/month) - Mix of both

## ðŸŽ¯ **Recommendations for JE Initiatives**

### 1. **Scale Current Team (Recommended)**
- Increase maintenance team hours to SOW levels
- Can accommodate npm package, Orchard tests, GovHub 2.0 planning
- ACN deploy refactor fits within Professional Services scope

### 2. **No Additional Budget Needed**
- SOW already includes Professional Services deliverables
- ACN integration explicitly mentioned in SOW Section 2.b
- Drupal upgrades and Storybook development covered

### 3. **Capacity Available**
- **181 hours/month unused capacity**
- Can handle significant initiative expansion
- Team already demonstrates professional services capability

## ðŸ“‹ **Meeting Talking Points**

### When JE asks: "Where do hours for special initiatives come from?"
**Answer**: "We have 181 unused hours per month within our existing SOW. The contract already provisions for Professional Services including ACN integration."

### When JE asks: "Should we reduce maintenance for Client Services?"
**Answer**: "No need. We're only using 9.3% of our SOW capacity. We can scale maintenance team hours AND accommodate initiatives."

### When JE asks: "Can your team handle technical initiatives?"
**Answer**: "Yes. Alexander is already doing 66% Professional Services work, and the team has delivered behat to playwright migrations and other initiatives."

## ðŸ”§ **SOW Contract Alignment**

### Already Covered in SOW Section 2.b Professional Services:
- âœ… **3rd-Party Tool Integration** (ACN deploy refactor)
- âœ… **Technical Strategy and Approach** (GovHub 2.0 planning)
- âœ… **Development of Storybook Components** (Orchard tests)
- âœ… **Professional Services Consulting Leadership**

### Current vs Contract:
- **Contract**: 200 hours/month ($35K/month)
- **Actual**: 18.6 hours/month average
- **Opportunity**: Scale to contract levels first

## ðŸš€ **Action Items**

1. **Increase team utilization** to SOW levels before considering external resources
2. **Prioritize JE's initiatives** within existing Professional Services scope
3. **Reserve ~200 hours** for ACN deploy refactor (as projected in your hours.csv)
4. **Document initiative breakdown** using existing #professional tags

## ðŸ“ˆ **Data Source**

Generated using new team analysis tool:
```bash
npm run team-summary
```

Analysis covers April 2025 (SOW start) through current date with actual logged hours from Noko project "[LSM] Georgia Support SON 2025 RETAINER (04404)".

**ðŸ’¡ Key Message**: The question isn't "reduce maintenance for initiatives" - it's "how do we properly utilize our full SOW capacity for both maintenance excellence AND JE's strategic initiatives."
